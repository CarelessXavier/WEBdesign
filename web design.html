    <p3><strong>The Letter to the Master of Creation</strong></p3> <br><br>
  <p5><em>Dear Master,</em></p5> <br><br>

    <p2>I am ill, but grieving more that you are ill, I make my <strong>stronger</strong> hand work long eno' to tell you. <u>I thought perhaps you were in <em>Heaven</em>, and when you spoke again, </u> it seemed quite sweet, and wonderful, and surprised me so - I wish that you were well. 


<p6>\I would that all I love, should be weak no more. </p6> The <pv>Violets</pv> are by my side, the <p12>Robin</p12> very near, and "Spring" - they say "Who is she" going by the door.
  
  <u>Indeed it is <strong>God's</strong> house - and these are gates of <em>Heaven</em></u>, and to and fro, the angels go, with their sweet postillions - <u>I wish that I were great, like Mr. Michael Angelo, and could paint for you.</u> <p6>You ask me what my flowers said - then they were disobedient - I gave them messages. </p6> <u>They said what the lips in the West, say, when the sun goes down, and so says the Dawn.</u>

  Listen again, <p5><em> Master, </em></p5> I did not tell you that today had been the<p7> <u>Sabbath Day.</u> </p7>
<br> <br>

  <p7>Each <u>Sabbath</u> on the Sea, makes me count the <u>Sabbaths</u>, till we meet on shore - and whether the hills will look as blue as the sailors say. </p7> <p6>I cannot talk any more tonight , for this pain denies me.</p6>
<br> <br>

  <p7>How <strong>strong</strong> when weak to recollect <p6>, and easy, quite,</p6> to <p9> love </p9>. Will you tell me <p6>, please to tell me,</p6> soon as you are well.</p7> </p2>

<p10> This version of the poem, with blacked out lines, make the poem apper more as a letter to God before she dies.<br>
     God being sick could reffer to religion dying in the developing world </p10>
