<p1> “Listen, <br>

   <pre>Saying life is unfair, <br> 
     is inherently unfair. <br> </pre> 
    Value isn’t based on if a single person cares - <br>
   <pre> it’s more than that.<br> </pre>
    It depends on the when and where, <br>
    <pre>not whether the things can compare.<br>
     The answer isn’t obvious, <br>
       doesn’t mean it isn’t there, <br></pre>
    Just because something is true, doesn’t mean it’s clear, <br>
   <pre>Still, you have no will to hear, <br>
      that’s living life out of fear, trapping yourself in despair,<br></pre> 
    Cause if you’re only willing to talk about and share <br>
    <pre>the ideas you already know -<br> 
         then you’ll never expand or grow,<br> </pre>
    like fish’s lungs breathing air. <br>
    <pre>Answers to your greatest problems  <br> 
    are in the places you’d never dare, to go.” </pre> 
    </p1> <br> <br>

This is a poem narrative styled peom of me and my friend arguing about what matters in life <br>
and how to better yourself as a person. He believes that everyone can make their opinionated own value of <br>
while at the same time believes no oe can be valueless - I claim it's a contradiction because if <br>
it's an idividuals choice, than an individual can make someone's value zero.
